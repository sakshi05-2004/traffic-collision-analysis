# 🚗 Traffic Collision Analysis – ETL & Visualization Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-world California traffic collision data to uncover key patterns and trends related to weather, time, location, and victim demographics. It includes data extraction, transformation using PySpark, and comprehensive visual storytelling using Python libraries.

---

## 🔍 Objective
- Clean and structure raw traffic collision data.
- Analyze trends across time, weather, age, and location.
- Deliver actionable insights for road safety improvements.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **PySpark** – For scalable data cleaning and transformation  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – For data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – For visual analytics  
- **AWS S3** – For data storage  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Majority of collisions occurred in **clear weather** and **daylight**, with peaks between **3–5 PM**.
- High-risk age groups include **16–24** and children aged **0–4**.
- **Fridays** and festive months like **March, October, and December** saw higher collision rates.
